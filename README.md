# pesto_code_submission
seq2seq model for customer care chatbot using transformers
Introduction
Customer support is a crucial aspect of any business, and providing timely and accurate responses to customer queries can significantly improve customer satisfaction. This project aims to develop a model that can generate automated responses to customer queries, reducing the workload on customer support teams and improving response times.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Customer-Support-Responses dataset, which contains a collection of customer queries and their corresponding responses.
Tasks
The main tasks for this project are:
Explore and preprocess the dataset.
Train a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model or use a transformer-based model like GPT-3 for generating responses.
Fine-tune the model for coherence and relevance.
Evaluate the generated responses for quality and appropriateness.
Deliverables
The deliverables for this project include:
Code and documentation
Response generation model
A demo where users can input a query and receive an automated response (implemented in a Jupyter notebook)
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
Transformers library
Datasets library
Pandas library
Installation
Clone the repository:
text
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-support-response-generation.git

Navigate to the project directory:
text
cd customer-support-response-generation

Create a virtual environment and activate it:
text
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

Install the required dependencies:
text
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Training the Model
To train the model, run the following script:
text
python train.py

This script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model.
Generating Responses
To generate responses using the trained model, run the following script:
text
python generate_response.py

This script will load the trained model, prompt the user for a query, and generate a response using the model.
